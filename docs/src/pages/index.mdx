ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

I've been thinking a lot about how we can make [Primer React](https://primer.style/components) a world-class component library.

This prototype is my way of getting my ideas about APIs, tooling, and documentation out of my head and into a format that will hopefully start some conversations.

So far, this protoype features:

- [New component and system prop categories](#new-component-and-system-prop-categories)
- [Autogenerated prop documentation](#autogenerated-prop-documentation)
- [A simplified private API](#a-simplified-private-api)
- [Type-safe `as` prop](#type-safe-as-prop)
- [Colocated component files](#colocated-component-files)
- [Autogenerated navigation](#autogenerated-navigation)
- [Experimental flexbox `gap` prop](#experimental-flexbox-gap-prop)
- [Component status labels](#component-status-labels)
- [TSDX](#tsdx)
- [Yarn workspaces](#yarn-workspaces)

Next, I'm keen to explore the following topics:

- Color modes
- Testing
- Theme reference documentation
- System prop documentation
- Theme customization
- Documentation versioning
- Changelog visibility
- Intellisense for theme values
- Intellisense in live code examples
- Responsive live code examples
- Code example line highlighting

If any of these ideas resonate with you or inspire new ideas, I'd love to hear about it. You can reach me on Slack or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/twitter).

## New component and system prop categories

reduce developer friction

## Autogenerated prop documentation

reduce developer friction

## A simplified private API

during the typescript refactor, I noticed we have four different ways of create components

styled() for simple components,

styled.attrs() when we need to set a few dom attributres,

function when we need nested mark up,

forwardRef if we nee to expose a ref prop

this makes contribution difficult because you have to guess which way to make a component

similar to how react used to have function and class components

we need have only one way to create components

i made a [Base](/Base) component that we can use to create all components

easier to contribute

increase use of design system

## Colocated component files

seamless contribution workflow

## Experimental flexbox `gap` prop

the gap prop makes once-tricky layouts trivial to implement

no need to figure out which is the most correct element to apply margin to

reduce developer friction

## Autogenerated navigation

seamless contribution workflow

## TSDX

Yarn workspaces
